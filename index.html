<h1>🚀 Migration from Azure DevOps to GitLab</h1>

<div class="section">

<div class="section">
    <h2>🔍 Introduction</h2>
    <p>As organizations grow and mature in their DevOps practices, it's essential to continuously align tooling with evolving needs. One of our recent success stories involved helping a client transition from Azure DevOps (ADO) to GitLab for managing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployments.</p>
    <p>The client had originally adopted ADO pipelines—powered by a self-hosted ADO Server Express Edition on a Windows VM in Azure and Linux-based ADO agents—for deploying their Platform Landing Zone.</p>
    <p>This zone spanned across five critical Azure subscriptions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔹 Connectivity</li>
        <li>🔹 Security</li>
        <li>🔹 Management</li>
        <li>🔹 Identity</li>
        <li>🔹 Common Services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the initial plan was to upgrade to ADO Enterprise Edition, the client was already leveraging GitLab for application development. To streamline operations and avoid the additional licensing costs, the decision was made to consolidate their CI/CD pipelines within GitLab.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>🧩 Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The primary challenge was to migrate complex, production-grade ADO pipelines to GitLab with minimal disruption to ongoing infrastructure deployments. An earlier assessment by another team projected a 2–3 month effort involving four full-time resources—an impractical timeline given the client’s fast-paced operational requirements.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>💡 Solution Overview</h2>
    <p>Given the urgency, our team stepped in, assumed full ownership, and successfully completed the migration in just two weeks. Our approach was strategic and laser-focused:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provisioning GitLab Runners</li>
        <li>Refactoring Terraform repositories</li>
        <li>Designing new GitLab pipelines tailored for infrastructure deployment</li>
    </ul>
